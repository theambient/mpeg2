# mpeg2 decoding library and decoder

This is pure D implementation of mpeg2 decoder writed just for fan and to sort out in detail how codec is organised.

Mpeg2 is video codec standardised by both ISO/IEC and ITU-T standartisation bodies also known as ISO/IEC 13818-2 and H.262.

The implementation contains both library and application as example of library usage.

I didn't packaged it as a dub library the time I wrote it and now, year after, when I'm writing this readme I'm too lazy to do it, sorry.
